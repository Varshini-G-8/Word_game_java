# Word Guess Game

A browser-based word guessing game developed using **Java**. The application supports two types of users: players, who can register and play the game, and administrators, who can view game activity reports.

## Overview

The Word Guess Game allows registered players to guess a randomly selected five-letter word within a maximum of five attempts.

The application supports two user roles:

* **Player** – registers, logs in, and plays the word guessing game.
* **Administrator** – accesses the administration dashboard and views game activity reports.

The application uses Java's built-in HTTP server for handling requests, HTML for page rendering, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactive gameplay, and local file storage for persisting application data.

| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🟩 Green  | Correct letter in the correct position   |
